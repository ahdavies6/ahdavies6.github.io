Hi! My name is Adam Davies, and I'm a first-year CS PhD student at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/).

My primary research interests include [XAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence)/[interpretable ML](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3236386.3241340), computational semantics, and (multimodal) representation learning. I'm experienced in NLP, data science, and machine learning (inc. deep learning) libraries in Python.

I graduated Cum Laude from the University of Utah in Spring 2021 with B.S. in both Computer Science and Cognitive Science. ([My bachelor's thesis](https://www.cs.utah.edu/docs/techreports/2021/PDF/UUCS-21-013.pdf))
