I am a member of my advisor Chengxiang Zhai's [TIMAN research group](http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/index.html), and I work as a doctoral research assistant with the [NCSA](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/).
I graduated Cum Laude from the University of Utah in Spring 2021 with a B.S. in both Computer Science and Cognitive Science.
(This was [my bachelor's thesis](https://www.cs.utah.edu/docs/techreports/2021/PDF/UUCS-21-013.pdf).)
