Hi! My name is Adam Davies, and I'm a first-year CS PhD student at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/).

I study [neural language models](https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-language-models-32bec14d01dc), particularly *the extent to which they process language like we humans do*.
These models are usually seen as being "black boxes", meaning that we do not (fully) understand what goes on inside them.
To better understand and explain the inner workings of these models, I research [machine learning interpretability](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3236386.3241340).
I am most interested in *how these models represent word meaning*, which involves [computational semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_semantics) and [representation learning](https://analyticsindiamag.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-representation-learning-for-beginners/).

I graduated Cum Laude from the University of Utah in Spring 2021 with B.S. in both Computer Science and Cognitive Science.
(This was [my bachelor's thesis](https://www.cs.utah.edu/docs/techreports/2021/PDF/UUCS-21-013.pdf).)
