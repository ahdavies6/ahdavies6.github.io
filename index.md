Hi! My name is Adam Davies, and I'm a first-year CS PhD student at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), advised by Professor [ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/).

I study [neural language models](https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-language-models-32bec14d01dc), specifically *how they learn and represent word meaning*.
I am currently researching how [counterfactual methodologies](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/counterfactual.html#counterfactual) can be applied to analyze the representation and use of word meaning in these models.
(For more details, see my [research agenda]({% link _pages/research.md %}).)

These are my [recent publications]({% link _pages/publications.md %}).

I am a member of my advisor ChengXiang Zhai's [TIMAN research group](http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/index.html), and I work as a doctoral research assistant with the [NCSA](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/).

I graduated *Cum Laude* from the University of Utah in Spring 2021 with a B.S. in both Computer Science and Cognitive Science, for which I was advised by Professors [Ellen Riloff](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~riloff/) and [Dustin Stokes](http://stokes.mentalpaint.net/Dustin_Stokes.html) (respectively).
