Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Adam Davies, and I'm a CS PhD candidate in the [Siebel School of Computing and Data Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/) at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/). This summer (2025), I'm also a research intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/).

My [research vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05859) is to help build the foundations of a ***cognitive science of AI*** -- that is: where cognitive scientists like psychologists, neuroscientists, linguists, or philosophers of mind study *how intelligent systems* like the minds/brains of humans (and other intelligent animals) *learn, represent, and process information,* I am focused on *performing [analogous study with respect to foundation models like LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05859).*
<!-- In particular, my main focus is on interpretable analysis of semantic representation in foundation models like large language models, studying how they learn, represent, and process the meaning in language. -->

[My work]({% link _pages/publications.md %}) intersects primarily with *natural language processing, (mechanistic) interpretability, cognitive science, and OOD generalization,* with a secondary focus on causal machine learning, synthetic data, multimodal representation learning, and computational social science.

## where's Adam?

**at MSR (Summer 2025):** I'm working with the [Neurocompositional AI team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/neurocompositional-ai/) in the [Deep Learning Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/deep-learning-group/) at Microsoft Research.
 
<!-- ***Current:*** -->
**at UIUC:** I'm co-advised by Professors [ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/) and [Julia Hockenmaier](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/juliahmr),
<!-- a member of Cheng Zhai's [TIMAN research group](https://timan.cs.illinois.edu/) and Julia Hockenmaier's [hmr-lab](https://hmr-lab.github.io/) at UIUC,  -->
and I work as a research assistant with the [INVITE institute](https://invite.illinois.edu/).
I also collaborate frequently with the [Torr Vision Group](https://torrvision.com/) at the University of Oxford.
<!-- (To get a sense for what I've been working on in this role, see my [recent]({% link _pages/publications.md %}#calm) [preprints]({% link _pages/publications.md %}#njpp) -- coming soon to a conference near you.) -->

<!-- ***Past:*** -->
<!-- I was a doctoral research assistant with the [NCSA](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/) from August 2021 through July 2022, 
and with Professor [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) from August 2022 through July 2023.
I graduated *cum laude* from the University of Utah in Spring 2021 with B.S. degrees in both Computer Science and Cognitive Science, for which I was advised by Professors [Ellen Riloff](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~riloff/) and [Dustin Stokes](http://stokes.mentalpaint.net/Dustin_Stokes.html) (respectively). -->
