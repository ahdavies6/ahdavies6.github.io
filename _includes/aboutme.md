Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Adam Davies, and I'm a CS PhD candidate in the [Siebel School of Computing and Data Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/) at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/).

<!-- My [research vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05859) is to help build the foundations of a ***cognitive science of AI*** -- that is: where cognitive scientists like psychologists, neuroscientists, linguists, or philosophers of mind study *how intelligent systems* like the minds/brains of humans (and other intelligent animals) *learn, represent, and process information,* I am focused on *performing [analogous study with respect to foundation models like LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05859).* -->
My research vision is to help build the foundations of a **[cognitive science of AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05859)**, studying how foundation models like LLMs learn, represent, and process information. 
[My work]({% link _pages/publications.md %}) focuses on how we can <ins>interpret and control the features learned and leveraged by these models,</ins> including <ins>how they are used in performing various tasks,</ins> and how to apply such knowledge/methods to <ins>predict and improve models' generalization to novel contexts.</ins> My current research intersects primarily with *NLP, (mechanistic) interpretability, cognitive science, OOD generalization, and causal machine learning;* but I also have ongoing collaborations in the areas of *synthetic data, multimodal representation learning, computational social science, and AI for education.*

## where's Adam?

<!-- **at MSR (Summer 2025):** I'm working with the [Neurocompositional AI team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/neurocompositional-ai/) in the [Deep Learning Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/deep-learning-group/) at Microsoft Research. -->
 
<!-- ***Current:*** -->
<!-- **at UIUC:**  -->
I'm co-advised by Professors [ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/) and [Julia Hockenmaier](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/juliahmr) at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/),
<!-- a member of Cheng Zhai's [TIMAN research group](https://timan.cs.illinois.edu/) and Julia Hockenmaier's [hmr-lab](https://hmr-lab.github.io/) at UIUC,  -->
and I work as a research assistant with the [INVITE institute](https://invite.illinois.edu/).
I also collaborate frequently with the [Torr Vision Group](https://torrvision.com/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/),
<!-- (To get a sense for what I've been working on in this role, see my [recent]({% link _pages/publications.md %}#calm) [preprints]({% link _pages/publications.md %}#njpp) -- coming soon to a conference near you.) -->
and recently (in Summer 2025) completed a research internship with the [Neurocompositional AI team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/neurocompositional-ai/) in the [Deep Learning Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/deep-learning-group/) at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/).

<!-- ***Past:*** -->
<!-- I was a doctoral research assistant with the [NCSA](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/) from August 2021 through July 2022, 
and with Professor [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) from August 2022 through July 2023.
I graduated *cum laude* from the University of Utah in Spring 2021 with B.S. degrees in both Computer Science and Cognitive Science, for which I was advised by Professors [Ellen Riloff](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~riloff/) and [Dustin Stokes](http://stokes.mentalpaint.net/Dustin_Stokes.html) (respectively). -->
