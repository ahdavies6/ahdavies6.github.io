Hi! My name is Adam Davies, and I'm a CS PhD student at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), advised by Professor [ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/).

My current research generally falls within natural language processing (NLP), computational semantics, (multimodal) representation learning, and interpretable machine learning. In particular, I am focused on interpretable analysis of learned representations of semantic content in contemporary [deep learning models for (vision and) language](https://theaisummer.com/vision-language-models/), studying how these models learn and represent the meaning in language as compared to us humans.
(For more details, see my [research agenda]({% link _pages/research.md %}).)

These are my [recent publications]({% link _pages/publications.md %}).

I am a member of my advisor ChengXiang Zhai's [TIMAN research group](http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/index.html), and I work as a doctoral research assistant with the [NCSA](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/).

I graduated *cum laude* from the University of Utah in Spring 2021 with B.S. degrees in both Computer Science and Cognitive Science, for which I was advised by Professors [Ellen Riloff](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~riloff/) and [Dustin Stokes](http://stokes.mentalpaint.net/Dustin_Stokes.html) (respectively).
