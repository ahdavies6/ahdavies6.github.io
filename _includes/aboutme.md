Hi! My name is Adam Davies, and I'm a CS PhD student at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) co-advised by Professor [ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/) and Professor [Julia Hockenmaier](https://hockenmaier.cs.illinois.edu/).

<!-- My current research generally falls within natural language processing (NLP), interpretable machine learning, computational semantics, and multimodal representation learning.  -->
My primary research areas are natural language processing, (mechanistic) interpretability, distribution-shift robustness, causal machine learning, synthetic data, and multimodal representation learning.
In particular, I am focused on interpretable analysis of semantic representation in large language models and multimodal vision-language models, studying how these models learn and represent the meaning in language and the visual world as compared to us humans.
(For more details, see my [research agenda]({% link _pages/research.md %}).)

These are my [recent publications]({% link _pages/publications.md %}).

<!-- ***Current:*** -->
I am a member of Prof. Zhai's [TIMAN research group](https://timan.cs.illinois.edu/) and Julia Hockenmaier's [Natural Language research group](https://hockenmaier.cs.illinois.edu/) at UIUC, and I work as a research assistant with the [INVITE institute](https://invite.illinois.edu/).
I also have several recent and ongoing collaborations with the [Torr Vision Group](https://torrvision.com/) at Oxford.
<!-- (To get a sense for what I've been working on in this role, see my [recent]({% link _pages/publications.md %}#calm) [preprints]({% link _pages/publications.md %}#njpp) -- coming soon to a conference near you.) -->

<!-- ***Past:*** -->
I was a doctoral research assistant with the [NCSA](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/) from August 2021 through July 2022, 
<!-- (see our [PASC 2022 paper]({% link _pages/publications.md %}#judel)), -->
and with Professor [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) from August 2022 through July 2023.
I graduated *cum laude* from the University of Utah in Spring 2021 with B.S. degrees in both Computer Science and Cognitive Science, for which I was advised by Professors [Ellen Riloff](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~riloff/) and [Dustin Stokes](http://stokes.mentalpaint.net/Dustin_Stokes.html) (respectively).
