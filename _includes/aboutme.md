Hi! My name is Adam Davies, and I'm a CS PhD student at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) advised by Professor [ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/).

My current research generally falls within natural language processing (NLP), computational semantics, (multimodal) representation learning, and interpretable machine learning. In particular, I am focused on interpretable analysis of semantic representation in contemporary deep learning models for language (and vision), studying how these models learn and represent the meaning in language as compared to us humans.
(For more details, see my [research agenda]({% link _pages/research.md %}).)

These are my [recent publications]({% link _pages/publications.md %}).

I am a member of the [TIMAN research group](http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/index.html), and I work as a doctoral research assistant with Professor [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html). (To get a sense for what I've been working on in this role, see my [recent]({% link _pages/publications.md %}#calm) [preprints]({% link _pages/publications.md %}#njpp) -- coming soon to a conference near you.)

I was a research assistant with the [NCSA](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/) from August 2021 through July 2022 (see our [PASC 2022 paper]({% link _pages/publications.md %}#judel)).
I graduated *cum laude* from the University of Utah in Spring 2021 with B.S. degrees in both Computer Science and Cognitive Science, for which I was advised by Professors [Ellen Riloff](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~riloff/) and [Dustin Stokes](http://stokes.mentalpaint.net/Dustin_Stokes.html) (respectively).
