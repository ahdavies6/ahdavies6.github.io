Hi! My name is Adam Davies, and I'm a CS PhD candidate at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) co-advised by Professor [ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/) and Professor [Julia Hockenmaier](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/juliahmr).

My research intersects with topics including natural language processing, (mechanistic) interpretability, cognitive science, distribution-shift robustness, causal machine learning, synthetic data, multimodal representation learning, and computational social science.
I like to describe my primary area of study as "cognitive neuropsychology of AI" -- where cognitive scientists like psychologists or neuroscientists study how intelligent systems like the human mind/brain learn, represent, and process information, I am focused on performing [similar analysis with respect to foundation models like LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05859).
<!-- In particular, my main focus is on interpretable analysis of semantic representation in foundation models like large language models, studying how they learn, represent, and process the meaning in language. -->

These are my [recent publications]({% link _pages/publications.md %}).

<!-- ***Current:*** -->
I am a member of Cheng Zhai's [TIMAN research group](https://timan.cs.illinois.edu/) and Julia Hockenmaier's [hmr-lab](https://hmr-lab.github.io/) at UIUC, and I work as a research assistant with the [INVITE institute](https://invite.illinois.edu/).
I also have several recent and ongoing collaborations with the [Torr Vision Group](https://torrvision.com/) at Oxford.
<!-- (To get a sense for what I've been working on in this role, see my [recent]({% link _pages/publications.md %}#calm) [preprints]({% link _pages/publications.md %}#njpp) -- coming soon to a conference near you.) -->

<!-- ***Past:*** -->
<!-- I was a doctoral research assistant with the [NCSA](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/) from August 2021 through July 2022, 
and with Professor [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) from August 2022 through July 2023.
I graduated *cum laude* from the University of Utah in Spring 2021 with B.S. degrees in both Computer Science and Cognitive Science, for which I was advised by Professors [Ellen Riloff](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~riloff/) and [Dustin Stokes](http://stokes.mentalpaint.net/Dustin_Stokes.html) (respectively). -->
